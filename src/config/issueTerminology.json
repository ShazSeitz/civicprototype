I need your help creating a database that can be stored in GitHub and referenced by my Lovable project that helps the LLM (which is ChatGPT aka you) to map political priorities in plan words to common terms used to reference those priorities in politics.  I want to make sure that the tool that I am building returns the same mapping consistently every time. 

Can you please first create a list of issues that represent what US voters have cared about most over the past say 20 years as a starting point?  

And then map that list to ways people might refer to those concerns in normal high school level english -- such as "I want violent criminals off the street" -- this does not map directly to "criminal justice reform" -- it should instead map to something like "public safety"

Below is an example of a static database—in JSON format—that you could store in GitHub. It lists a set of issues that U.S. voters have cared about over roughly the past 20 years and pairs each with a plain‐English phrase that someone (say, at a high school level) might use to express that concern. You can expand or adjust the list as needed, but this should serve as a consistent starting point for your Lovable project.

{
  "issues": [
    {
      "political_priority": "Economic Growth and Job Creation",
      "plain_english": "I want more good jobs and a strong economy."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Healthcare Access and Affordability",
      "plain_english": "I want affordable healthcare and quality medical services for everyone."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Public Safety and Criminal Justice",
      "plain_english": "I want violent criminals off the street and safer neighborhoods."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Immigration Reform",
      "plain_english": "I want fair immigration laws and secure borders."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Education and Student Opportunity",
      "plain_english": "I want quality, affordable education for every kid."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Environmental Protection and Climate Action",
      "plain_english": "I want clean air, clean water, and action to fight climate change."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "National Security and Defense",
      "plain_english": "I want our country to be safe from terrorists and other threats."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Government Transparency and Integrity",
      "plain_english": "I want honest, open government that works for the people."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Tax Policy and Fiscal Responsibility",
      "plain_english": "I want fair taxes that don’t take too much of my paycheck."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Social Security and Retirement Security",
      "plain_english": "I want to be sure I can retire with enough money."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Gun Control and Regulation",
      "plain_english": "I want to keep dangerous guns out of the wrong hands."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Civil Rights and Equality",
      "plain_english": "I want equal rights and fair treatment for everyone."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Infrastructure and Public Services",
      "plain_english": "I want safer roads, bridges, and better public transportation."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Housing Affordability",
      "plain_english": "I want housing that is affordable for everyday people."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Energy Policy and Independence",
      "plain_english": "I want reliable and affordable energy for our communities."
    }
  ]
}

How This Mapping Works

    Political Priority: This field lists the issue using common political or policy terms. For example, "Public Safety and Criminal Justice" is a standard term used in policy debates.
    Plain English: This field provides a high school–level phrasing that captures the essence of the concern. For example, instead of using “criminal justice reform,” it uses “I want violent criminals off the street” to emphasize the aspect of safety.

This structure helps your Lovable project consistently translate between more formal political categories and everyday language. Feel free to add, remove, or refine entries as you gather more input from your users or further research political trends.

I think this needs to be quite a bit more comprehensive.  For example, using the above, if I said "My biggest political priority is that we save democracy from greedy demogagues" what would you return ad my concern?

Below is an expanded, more comprehensive JSON database mapping a broad set of political issues (as seen by U.S. voters over the past 20 years) to plain‐English expressions of those concerns. For example, if someone said,

    "My biggest political priority is that we save democracy from greedy demagogues"

the tool would match that concern to the entry below with a political priority of "Defending Democracy and Political Integrity" and a plain-English phrasing of "I want to protect our democracy from greedy leaders who don't care about us."

You can store this database in GitHub and reference it consistently in your Lovable project.

How It Works

    Mapping Process:
    When your tool receives a plain-English concern (like the example about saving democracy), it will search for the best match in this database. In this case, it finds that the concern maps to the "Defending Democracy and Political Integrity" category.

    Consistency:
    Storing this database on GitHub means that every time the Lovable project is run, it references the same mapping, ensuring consistent translations between political priorities and everyday language.

Feel free to further refine or expand the entries as you gather more input or identify additional areas of concern.

# Top Voter Issues

1. **Economic Conditions (Inflation, Job Security, and Cost of Living):**
    - **Updated Findings:**The latest Pew report (February 20, 2025) underscores that Americans remain deeply concerned about economic issues. Key concerns include persistent inflation, wage stagnation, and the rising cost of living. The new findings also highlight that these issues continue to cut across demographic lines, affecting both traditional sectors and emerging economic challenges such as regional disparities and the impact of supply chain disruptions.
    - **Key Sources:**
        - Pew Research Center’s February 2025 report provides a detailed breakdown of how these economic issues are viewed as national problems.
        - Gallup’s October 2024 poll reinforces these findings by showing persistent voter anxieties regarding economic prospects.
2. **Healthcare Access and Affordability:**
    - **Updated Findings:**In addition to high costs and insurance hurdles, recent surveys note a growing public demand for better mental health services and improved long-term care solutions. This expanded focus reflects the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on public health priorities.
    - **Key Sources:**
        - Studies from both Pew and Gallup consistently show that healthcare remains a top concern, with new emphasis on mental health care emerging as a critical policy area.
3. **Climate Change and Environmental Policy:**
    - **Updated Findings:**Climate change continues to be a major voter concern, with increased focus on the direct impacts of extreme weather events and environmental degradation. Voters—especially younger demographics and residents in high-risk areas—are calling for more aggressive adaptation and mitigation measures to protect public health and economic stability.
    - **Key Sources:**
        - Recent analyses by Pew highlight the growing awareness of environmental risks and their broad impact on society.
4. **Immigration and Border Security:**
    - **Updated Findings:**The conversation around immigration has evolved. While border security remains important, new data show that voters are also considering the economic and social contributions of immigrant communities. There is growing recognition of the need to balance security with policies that promote integration and economic opportunity.
    - **Key Sources:**
        - Surveys from Reuters/Ipsos and ANES now capture these dual perspectives—emphasizing both security and the broader social benefits of immigration.
5. **Political Polarization, Democratic Governance, and Information Integrity:**
    - **Updated Findings:**With increasing partisan divides and the pervasive influence of misinformation, voters are more concerned than ever about the integrity of democratic processes. New survey questions link the spread of disinformation on social media with declining trust in government institutions, highlighting a modern challenge to democratic governance.
    - **Key Sources:**
        - Updated Gallup and Pew surveys now include measures of how digital misinformation is eroding public trust, making it a critical issue alongside traditional political concerns.

### Considerations for Defending the Updated List

- **Multiple Data Points:**
    
    Each issue is supported by several updated and reputable sources. The new Pew report, in particular, reinforces the continued salience of economic concerns while other sources validate trends in healthcare, environmental policy, immigration, and political governance.
    
- **Cross-Cutting Themes:**
    
    Economic security, healthcare, and environmental risks are deeply interconnected with voters’ broader perceptions of governance and societal well-being. Issues such as misinformation and political polarization further influence how these concerns are prioritized.
    
- **Demographic Nuances:**
    
    While some issues (for example, the impact of climate change or digital misinformation) resonate more strongly with younger or region-specific groups, the overall trends are widely supported across diverse demographic segments.
    
- **Consistency Over Time and New Developments:**
    
    The updated list reflects both long-standing voter priorities and new dimensions introduced by the latest research, ensuring a comprehensive picture of the evolving national mood.

Below is an updated and more comprehensive JSON database that not only incorporates the five top issues from the updated list but also adds several additional issues that have remained important over the past two decades. This expanded mapping ensures that your Lovable project can consistently reference a wide array of political priorities and their plain‐English counterparts.

For example, if a user said:

    "My biggest political priority is that we save democracy from greedy demagogues"

the tool would match that to the entry for "Political Polarization, Democratic Governance, and Information Integrity" with a plain-English mapping like:

    "I want to fix our broken politics, stop fake news, and keep our government honest and fair."

Below is the complete JSON mapping:

{
  "issues": [
    {
      "political_priority": "Economic Conditions (Inflation, Job Security, and Cost of Living)",
      "plain_english": "I want a strong economy where prices are fair, jobs are secure, and my paycheck goes further."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Healthcare Access and Affordability",
      "plain_english": "I want affordable healthcare that covers everything from doctor visits to mental health and long-term care."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Climate Change and Environmental Policy",
      "plain_english": "I want our government to take action on climate change and protect our environment from extreme weather and pollution."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Immigration and Border Security",
      "plain_english": "I want fair immigration policies that secure our borders while giving hardworking immigrants a chance."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Political Polarization, Democratic Governance, and Information Integrity",
      "plain_english": "I want to fix our broken politics, stop fake news, and keep our government honest and fair."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Housing Affordability and Homelessness Prevention",
      "plain_english": "I want safe, affordable housing for everyone and solutions to prevent homelessness."
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Education and Student Opportunity",
      "plain_english": "I want quality and affordable education for every student so we can build a better future."
    },

    }
  ]
}

Additional Considerations

    Updated Priorities: The first five entries directly reflect the updated voter concerns with recent findings from reputable sources (Pew, Gallup, Reuters/Ipsos, and ANES).
    Expanded Scope: Additional entries cover long-standing issues such as housing, education, public safety, income inequality, and technology—ensuring your tool can handle a broad range of voter expressions.
    Plain-English Mapping: Each plain-English statement is phrased at a high school level, aiming for clarity and consistency in translating political jargon to everyday language.

This structure should provide a robust and consistent reference for your Lovable project. Feel free to further adjust or add entries as you gather more insights or if new priorities emerge.
You said:
What if someone entered this priority "We should stay with NATO allies"

For an input like "We should stay with NATO allies," your tool could match it to a foreign policy–related priority. For example, you might return an entry like:

{
  "political_priority": "Foreign Policy and National Security",
  "plain_english": "I want to keep strong ties with our friends abroad, like NATO, to help keep our country safe and respected."
}

Explanation

    Foreign Policy and National Security:
    This category broadly covers issues related to international alliances, defense commitments, and global leadership. Staying with NATO allies is a specific expression of that broader perspective.

    Plain-English Mapping:
    The plain-English version emphasizes maintaining strong international relationships and security, which is the essence of the original statement.

Depending on how granular you want your mappings, you could also consider creating a distinct category for international alliances (for example, "International Alliances and Global Leadership") if you foresee many inputs emphasizing specific alliances. However, for consistency and to avoid overly fragmenting related issues, grouping it under Foreign Policy and National Security works well in this context.
You said:
Great. Is the current list missing anything that you originally proposed? Anything that feels like it needs to be included?  

After reviewing both the updated list and the original proposals, here are some observations:
What the Current List Covers

    Updated Top Voter Concerns:
    The list now directly reflects recent findings—covering economic conditions, healthcare, climate change, immigration, and political polarization. These align well with the latest reports from Pew, Gallup, and Reuters/Ipsos.

    Additional Key Areas:
    You’ve also expanded the mapping to include issues like housing affordability, education, public safety, income inequality, technology/data privacy, foreign policy, and labor rights. This expansion captures a broad range of voter concerns that have been prominent over the past 20 years.

Potential Gaps Relative to the Original Proposals

While the current list is robust, the original mapping included a few topics that aren’t explicitly present in the current version. Depending on the level of granularity you desire, you might consider including the following:

    Government Transparency and Accountability:
    Many voters stress the need for an open and honest government. Although aspects of this concern might be inferred under “Political Polarization, Democratic Governance, and Information Integrity,” an explicit category could be useful.

    Tax Policy and Fiscal Responsibility:
    Discussions about fair taxes and responsible spending have been central to voter debates. Adding a specific mapping for fiscal concerns could further refine your tool’s accuracy.

    Social Security and Retirement Security:
    With an aging population, the stability of retirement benefits remains a critical issue for many voters. This could be an important standalone category.

    Gun Control (if needed separately):
    While public safety is covered, some voters express specific concerns about gun control measures. Depending on your project's scope, you might consider separating this from the broader “Public Safety and Criminal Justice” category.

Conclusion

The current list is comprehensive for capturing the most updated and broadly impactful voter issues. However, if you aim to cover the full spectrum of political concerns from the past 20 years, you might consider adding separate entries for:

    Government Transparency and Accountability
    Tax Policy and Fiscal Responsibility
    Social Security and Retirement Security
    Potentially a distinct Gun Control category

These additions would ensure that your Lovable project fully reflects both longstanding and emerging voter priorities.
You said:

Explanation

    New Additions:
    The new entries explicitly cover women's rights, civil liberties, abortion and reproductive rights, separation of church and state, and LGBTQ+ rights/inclusion. This ensures that concerns such as trans rights (and specifically issues like trans women in sports) are addressed within the broader LGBTQ+ framework.

    Consistent Plain-English:
    Each plain-English mapping is designed to be accessible (roughly at a high school level) while capturing the essence of the political priority.

    Comprehensive Coverage:
    By combining longstanding concerns with emerging issues, this database aims to reflect the full spectrum of voter priorities from the past 20 years.

This updated mapping should now cover the topics you've mentioned, ensuring that your Lovable project consistently translates a wide array of voter expressions into standardized political priorities.
You said:
I think you need to add opposing views like Limited Abortion, and anti-wokeness.  How do we address a user input like "I'm tired of woke politics. I want to live in a post-racial reality, and preferably one without forced pronouns"

Below is an updated JSON database that not only preserves the earlier mappings but also adds entries for opposing views such as limited abortion (pro-life) and anti-woke politics. This ensures that your Lovable project can consistently map a wide range of voter expressions—including those that oppose progressive positions—to standardized political priorities.

For example, if a user inputs:

Summary

    Inclusivity:
    The database now includes both progressive priorities (like abortion and LGBTQ+ rights) and their opposing viewpoints (such as limited abortion/pro-life and anti-woke politics).

    Granularity:
    Each entry maps a specific political priority to a plain-English phrase, making it easy for your tool to consistently translate user inputs into standardized categories.

    Flexibility:
    With entries like "Opposing Woke Politics and Affirming Traditional Values," your project can capture inputs that express frustration with politically correct mandates and identity politics.

This comprehensive mapping should cover a wide range of voter concerns, ensuring that your Lovable project can reliably interpret and reference the intended political priorities.
You said:
How do you define "Traditional values". and also "Morals"?

Traditional Values refer to the enduring beliefs, customs, and norms that have been passed down over generations within a society. They often include ideas about family structure, community roles, religious faith, patriotism, and respect for established institutions. Traditional values are usually invoked to preserve social order and cultural heritage, and what qualifies as "traditional" can vary widely depending on historical, cultural, and regional contexts.

Morals are the principles or standards that individuals and communities use to distinguish right from wrong or good from bad behavior. Unlike traditional values, which are more about collective and long-standing cultural norms, morals tend to be personal ethical guidelines. They can be influenced by cultural, religious, philosophical, or personal experiences and may evolve over time as individuals and societies reflect on their beliefs.

Both concepts are fluid and can differ significantly across different communities, cultures, and historical periods, meaning that discussions around them are often nuanced and context-dependent.

Explanation

    Moral Values and Ethical Standards:
    This entry captures concerns centered on upholding shared ethical principles and a clear sense of right and wrong in society.

    Individual Freedom and Personal Liberty:
    This entry addresses desires for personal autonomy, allowing individuals to make their own choices without excessive government interference.

    Patriotism and National Pride:
    This entry emphasizes love for one's country, respect for its traditions, and the desire for national strength and unity.

By incorporating these new mappings, your Lovable project will be even more capable of interpreting and standardizing a broad spectrum of political expressions.
You said:
The biggest and worst errors that my prototype is making has to do with understanding the nuances of people's attitudes towards affirmative action, DEI hiring, and identity politics.  

While many people probably have harsh black and white opinions on these, many are also more in the middle... agreeing for example that affirmative action by income and opportunity make sense, but find affirmative action racist.  Many are ok with trans people but don't with to personally have to declare their "pronouns."  And some don't know the lingo to talk about these things at all, but have humanistic leanings but misgivings about how far things have gone.

How can we build into the terminology look up the capacity to try and analyze nuance and return accurate mapped terms??

To handle nuanced views—like those around affirmative action, DEI hiring, and identity politics—you can extend your mapping system in a few key ways:
1. Multi-Dimensional Mapping

Instead of a one-to-one mapping, design a multi-dimensional structure that separates out various aspects of an issue. For example, for affirmative action you might track:

    Basis of Action: (e.g., income-based vs. race-based)
    Degree of Support: (e.g., strong support, moderate support, or opposition)
    Associated Policies: (e.g., DEI hiring, quotas, or holistic review)

This way, when someone says, "I support affirmative action by income but find race-based policies problematic," the tool can reference the income-based subcategory while flagging the race-based aspect with a different nuance.
2. Incorporate Nuance Attributes or Weightings

You can add additional fields to each mapping entry to capture these subtleties. For example, you might include a "nuance" object with weighted scores or keywords. Consider a structure like this:

{
  "political_priority": "Affirmative Action and Identity Politics",
  "plain_english": "I think programs that help people based on income make sense, but using race as a basis can be unfair.",
  "nuance": {
    "affirmative_action_income": 0.8,
    "affirmative_action_race": -0.5,
    "DEI_hiring": -0.3,
    "identity_politics": 0.0
  }
}

Here, each key under "nuance" captures a particular aspect, with a score indicating the level of support (positive) or opposition (negative). This allows your system to analyze a user's input more finely and return a mapping that reflects mixed sentiments.
3. Fuzzy Matching and Contextual Analysis

Rather than relying solely on keyword matching, implement a fuzzy matching algorithm that can:

    Extract Sentiment and Intensity: Use sentiment analysis to gauge whether the user is leaning toward one perspective or is conflicted.
    Identify Key Phrases: Recognize when a user might say things like “I’m okay with trans people but don’t want to declare pronouns” or “affirmative action is good for income disparity, but race-based measures are problematic.”

This combination of sentiment analysis and fuzzy matching can help the tool parse layered statements.
4. Interactive Clarification

When the system detects ambiguous language, consider prompting the user for clarification. For example:

    "When you mention affirmative action, do you mean measures based on income, race, or both?"
    "Could you elaborate on your thoughts about DEI hiring—what aspects do you support or oppose?"

This not only helps refine the mapping but also gives users a chance to articulate their nuanced views.
5. Modular and Extensible Taxonomy

Build your terminology lookup as an extensible taxonomy where each issue is broken down into subcategories with detailed metadata. For instance:

    Affirmative Action
        Income-based measures
        Race-based measures
        Holistic admissions
    DEI Hiring
        Quota systems
        Inclusive practices
        Merit-based adjustments
    Identity Politics
        Language/Pronoun usage
        Group identity vs. individual rights

Using this hierarchical structure, your tool can match inputs at multiple levels, capturing both the broad category and the fine-grained details.
Summary

By incorporating a multi-dimensional, weighted mapping system—supported by fuzzy matching, contextual analysis, and interactive clarification—you can greatly improve your prototype’s ability to capture and accurately map nuanced positions on complex issues. This approach ensures that mixed or ambivalent attitudes (for instance, supporting income-based affirmative action but opposing race-based measures) are correctly reflected in your standardized output.

These strategies should help you build a terminology lookup that is both robust and sensitive to the complexities of modern political attitudes.

Can you give me just the new parts for the JSON file so I can add it?

Below is a snippet you can add to your existing JSON file. These new entries include a "nuance" object with weighted attributes to help capture the mixed and nuanced positions regarding affirmative action, DEI hiring, identity politics, and related topics.

{
  "issues": [
    {
      "political_priority": "Affirmative Action, DEI Hiring, and Identity Politics",
      "plain_english": "I support programs that help people based on income opportunities, but I have concerns about race-based measures and the excesses of identity politics.",
      "nuance": {
        "affirmative_action_income": 0.7,
        "affirmative_action_race": -0.6,
        "DEI_hiring": -0.4,
        "identity_politics": -0.2
      }
    },
    {
      "political_priority": "Nuanced LGBTQ+ Policies and Pronoun Usage",
      "plain_english": "I'm okay with supporting trans rights and inclusion, but I don't want to be forced to declare my pronouns or follow rigid identity labels.",

        "pronoun_mandate": -0.5,
        "rigid_identity_labels": -0.3
      }
    }
  ]
}

How to Use This

    Weighted Attributes:
    Each key under "nuance" represents a specific aspect of the issue, with positive values indicating support and negative values indicating opposition.
    Multi-Dimensional Analysis:
    When your tool processes a user input, it can compare these weights to the sentiment derived from the input, thereby capturing the nuances of mixed opinions.

Feel free to adjust the weightings and plain-English text to best fit your project’s needs.
You said:
Is there a way to add this nuance object for ALL categories in the terminology look up table?

Yes, you can add a "nuance" object to every category in your lookup table. This approach standardizes the schema so that every entry has a place for nuanced scores—even if for many categories the object might be empty or contain default values. For example, you might structure it like this:

Implementation Notes

    Every category now includes a "nuance" object. For some topics, we’ve populated it with sample weighting keys (reflecting dimensions such as support for a policy, economic impact, or cultural aspects), while for others you can further refine or expand the keys based on your analytic needs.
    This standardized schema will help your tool analyze and map nuanced political expressions consistently.

Feel free to modify the nuance keys and values as your understanding of voter attitudes evolves.
You said:
Let's fix something.  I don't think you can assume that anyone is "middle class" based on most of the terms that map to "middle class tax relief.  That is an assumption and we don't want those.

If they say middle class, than it's correct.  If they just say lower taxes, they could be from any tax bracket and that doesn't make sense.  

Can you please add specificity and be careful to NEVER assume you know more than the user has stated?

Below is the updated JSON file with all categories including a "nuance" object. In particular, the Middle Class Tax Relief category has been adjusted so that only phrases explicitly referencing "middle class" or "working families" are included. This way, if a user simply says "lower taxes" without specifying a group, the mapping won’t incorrectly assume they’re talking about the middle class.

Key Changes

    Middle Class Tax Relief:
    The "plainLanguage" array for taxCutsForMiddleClass now only includes phrases explicitly referencing the middle class or working families. This avoids assuming a user's tax bracket when they use more generic language about lowering taxes.

    Consistency:
    Every category now includes a "nuance" object—even if some are populated only with sample weightings—so that your tool can later adjust and capture detailed sentiments as needed.

This updated structure should help ensure that the mapping remains as faithful as possible to what users actually state, without making assumptions beyond their expressed views.
You said:
I don't see any nuance in terms of climate change.  Someone who is a skeptic or denier is not wanting to see government action on climate change. This needs the same level of nuance that we gave to identity politics. 

Below is the updated "climate" category with added nuance keys to capture both support for government action on climate change and the opposing view of climate skepticism/denial:

"climate": {
  "plainLanguage": [
    "climate change",
    "global warming",
    "climate skepticism",
    "climate denial",
    "extreme weather",
    "pollution"
  ],
  "standardTerm": "Climate Change and Environmental Policy",
  "plainEnglish": "I want our government to take action on climate change and protect our environment from extreme weather and pollution.",
  "nuance": {
    "climate_action": 0.8,
    "environmental_protection": 0.9,
    "climate_skepticism": -0.8
  }
}

Explanation

    climate_action: A positive score indicates support for government intervention and proactive climate policies.
    environmental_protection: A positive score reflects the desire to protect the environment.
    climate_skepticism: A negative score represents skepticism or denial of climate change, indicating opposition to government intervention.

This addition brings the same level of nuance to the climate category as seen in the identity politics mappings, ensuring your tool doesn’t assume a one-sided view and respects the full range of user opinions.
You said:
Please add similar nuances for ALL TERMS and flag "hoax" as a likely term for climate denial.

Below is the updated JSON file with each category’s nuance object expanded to capture both positive and negative dimensions. In addition, for the climate category we’ve added "hoax" to the plainLanguage array and a dedicated nuance key to flag that term as a strong indicator of climate denial.

Notes

    For Each Category:
    Every category now includes a "nuance" object with keys reflecting both support (positive values) and opposition (negative values) dimensions. These keys can be adjusted as your understanding of voter sentiment evolves.

    Climate Category Updates:
    The plainLanguage array now includes the term "hoax," and two nuance keys—"climate_skepticism" and "climate_hoax"—capture the negative sentiment toward government action on climate change.

This schema should help your tool recognize and differentiate nuanced positions across all issues without making assumptions beyond what the user states.
You said:
Great.  Can we add a rule that if the user enters something that appears conflicted or just too vague to map, that the result is "Can you please clarify your stance on [user's language]?"

You can add a fallback rule in your mapping logic so that if the user's input is too vague or shows conflicting views, your system returns a request for clarification. For example, you might implement a rule like this:

    Fallback Rule:
    If the highest confidence score among the matching mappings is below a certain threshold (or if multiple categories are equally matched in opposing ways), then return:

        "Can you please clarify your stance on [user's language]?"

You can represent this fallback in your code logic (outside of the static JSON mapping) or even add a dedicated fallback entry in your JSON file. For instance, here’s a simple JSON snippet for a fallback mapping:

{
  "fallback": {
    "standardTerm": "Clarification Needed",
    "plainEnglish": "Can you please clarify your stance on [user's language]?",
    "nuance": {}
  }
}

How to Implement It

    Match User Input:
    Process the input against your mappings and calculate a confidence score based on the nuance keys and keyword matches.

    Determine Ambiguity:
    If no single mapping exceeds your confidence threshold—or if conflicting nuance scores are detected—trigger the fallback.

    Return Clarification Request:
    Respond with the fallback message asking for clarification.

This rule ensures that your tool doesn’t make assumptions when a user’s input is ambiguous or conflicted, and it invites the user to provide additional details.
You said:
Ok this is really hard.  This user input: I think that it is disgraceful that race or gender are used to decide whether or not to hire someone.

Is returning: • Women's Rights and Gender Equality

Do you see why that is totally wrong?  How do we fix?  

Below is one approach to fix the issue:

The problem is that when someone states, “I think that it is disgraceful that race or gender are used to decide whether or not to hire someone,” the system is incorrectly mapping that to a category like "Women's Rights and Gender Equality." That category is designed to capture support for gender equality—not opposition to using race or gender in hiring decisions.

To fix this, we can add a new mapping category (or update our existing affirmative action/dei category) to explicitly capture opposition to race- or gender-based hiring policies. For example, you might add a category such as:

{
  "opposeRaceGenderHiring": {
    "plainLanguage": [
      "disgraceful to use race in hiring",
      "disgraceful to use gender in hiring",
      "hiring based on race",
      "hiring based on gender",
      "merit based hiring only",
      "no quotas in hiring"
    ],
    "standardTerm": "Opposition to Race and Gender-Based Hiring Policies",
    "plainEnglish": "I believe that hiring should be based solely on merit, and it's disgraceful to use race or gender as deciding factors.",
    "nuance": {
      "oppose_affirmative_action_race": -0.8,
      "oppose_affirmative_action_gender": -0.8,
      "merit_based_hiring_support": 0.8
    }
  }
}

How This Helps

    Specificity:
    The new category specifically targets negative sentiment about using race or gender in hiring. This prevents a misclassification under categories that are meant to promote gender equality or affirmative action.

    Nuance:
    The nuance keys differentiate between support for merit-based hiring and opposition to race/gender considerations in employment. This helps your tool capture the conflicting attitudes.

    Fallback Clarity:
    When a user expresses conflicting or ambiguous positions, your system can now check if their language matches either the positive side (supporting affirmative action) or the negative side (merit-based, no quotas) and respond accordingly.

By adding this new mapping, the input “I think that it is disgraceful that race or gender are used to decide whether or not to hire someone” will be more accurately mapped to "Opposition to Race and Gender-Based Hiring Policies" rather than erroneously falling under "Women's Rights and Gender Equality."

Feel free to adjust the plain language phrases and nuance weightings based on further testing and user feedback.

Ok so I have a build in Lovable that is not working correctly.  I think the problem is that the config files on GitHub are not referencing eachother and possibly the product requirement doc is now totally out of date.

- **When Something is Unclear**:  -- in the product requirements needs to be overhauled to map to the functionality of the terminology look up

AND the product requirements need to capture the requirement that hard to map terms are captured in a separate config file so that I can learn over time how better to update the terminology json file  -- that file is called needsTermMapping.json

Can you update these requirements accordingly?  

Below is an updated section of your product requirements that aligns the terminology lookup functionality (with all the nuance mappings) to your overall system behavior. In addition, we've added a requirement to capture hard-to-map terms in a separate configuration file called needsTermMapping.json. You can integrate this updated section into your overall requirements document.
3. How to Handle Different Situations
3.1. Mapping User Input to Terminology Categories

    Terminology Lookup Function:
    All user inputs are processed through a centralized terminology lookup function that references a master JSON configuration file (the "Terminology JSON") stored on GitHub. This file includes:
        A comprehensive list of political issues.
        A "plainLanguage" array for keyword matching.
        A "standardTerm" field that standardizes the political priority.
        A "plainEnglish" description that expresses the concept in high-school level language.
        A "nuance" object with weighted keys to capture both supportive and opposing sentiments.
        For example, the "climate" category includes nuance keys such as "climate_action", "environmental_protection", "climate_skepticism", and "climate_hoax", which allow the system to detect if a user is a climate change supporter or skeptic.

    Cross-Referencing Config Files:
    Ensure that all configuration files on GitHub reference each other appropriately. In particular:
        The primary Terminology JSON must be referenced by the lookup function.
        Any updates to nuance or term definitions should propagate consistently across the system.

3.2. Handling Unclear or Conflicted Inputs

    Detection of Ambiguity:
    The system should analyze the user’s input to calculate a confidence score for each matched category. If the highest confidence score falls below a defined threshold, or if multiple categories are matched with conflicting nuance values (e.g., both positive and negative sentiments of a given issue are present), then the input is considered ambiguous.

    Fallback Response:
    In cases where the input is too vague or shows conflicting views, the system should not force a mapping. Instead, it should return a standardized fallback message:

        "Can you please clarify your stance on [user's language]?"

    This ensures that the tool never assumes more than what the user explicitly states.

3.3. Capturing Hard-to-Map Terms

    Hard-to-Match Terms Logging:
    Any user input that cannot be confidently mapped to an existing category should be logged. These terms and the context in which they were used will be captured in a separate configuration file named needsTermMapping.json.

    Continuous Improvement:
    The needsTermMapping.json file will serve as a feedback mechanism. It should include:
        The raw user input.
        The confidence scores of any attempted mappings.
        An indication that the input did not meet the threshold for a clear mapping.

    This file enables product and data teams to review ambiguous cases and update the Terminology JSON accordingly.

Integration into the Overall System

    Configuration Management:
    All configuration files (Terminology JSON and needsTermMapping.json) must be stored in a dedicated GitHub repository with clear documentation on how they interrelate.

    Product Requirements Alignment:
    The updated product requirements now explicitly require:
        A terminology lookup function that uses nuanced mappings.
        A fallback mechanism for ambiguous inputs.
        A feedback loop via the needsTermMapping.json file to continuously improve the mapping accuracy.

By incorporating these updates, the product now better captures user intent without making unfounded assumptions, while also enabling continuous refinement based on real-world input.

Feel free to adjust any of the thresholds or nuance keys as needed based on further testing and user feedback.

# Voter Information Tool - Project Overview

## Intent
To provide an accessible, free tool for US voters that:
- Gives nonpartisan voting advice based on where you live and what matters to you
- Makes clear suggestions without political bias
- Works for both current elections and practice mode
- Connects your concerns to real political data
- Helps you take action on what matters to you

## Core Rules

### 1. Data Rules
- Never make up election data
- Only use real facts from trusted sources
- Exception: Practice mode uses 4 fixed presidential candidates

### 2. How to Talk to Users
- Be friendly and professional
- Say things like "I understand" or "I notice"
- Be helpful without being pushy
- Treat all users with respect
- Don't assume political views
- Use neutral words, not political terms
- Focus on issues, not parties
- Be a helpful tool, not an advisor
- Don't take sides on any issue

### 3. How to Handle Different Situations
- **When Something is Unclear**:
  - Ask simple questions to understand better
  - Example: "You mentioned schools. Could you tell me what about schools matters most to you?"
  - Use the same words the user used
  - For tricky topics, ask clear questions
  - Example: "I see you're concerned about the Jan 6th events. Are you worried about pardons for the people involved?"

- **When Priorities Might Conflict**:
  - Simply point out the conflict
  - Example: "Better public transit and lower taxes might be hard to do at the same time. I'll show you options for both."
  - Don't judge the conflict
  - Just provide options for both sides

- **When Users Say Something Inappropriate**:
  - Just say "Sorry, I can't help with that"
  - Don't repeat bad language
  - Move on to the next topic

- **When Users Mention Political Parties**:
  - Say: "I'll show you all options that match what you care about"
  - Focus on issues, not parties
  - Stay neutral

### 4. How to Structure Responses
- Start with:
  

"Here's what I understand you care about: [list issues].
  [If needed: One simple sentence about conflicts]
  [If needed: One simple question to understand better]"


- Then give suggestions:
  

"Based on your interest in [topic], here are some options that might work for you..."


- Always check if users want to change or add anything
- Keep it short and clear
- When there are conflicts, show options for both sides

Below is the updated section of your product requirements. It revises the "How to Handle Different Situations" section to reflect the functionality of the nuanced terminology lookup—and it adds the requirement to capture ambiguous or hard-to-map terms in a separate config file called needsTermMapping.json.
3. How to Handle Different Situations
3.1. Mapping and Analyzing User Input

    Terminology Lookup Function:
    All user input is processed through a centralized terminology lookup function that uses a master JSON configuration file stored on GitHub. This file includes:
        A comprehensive list of political issues.
        A "plainLanguage" array for keyword matching.
        A "standardTerm" field that standardizes the political priority.
        A "plainEnglish" description for accessible explanation.
        A "nuance" object with weighted keys capturing both supportive and opposing sentiments for each issue.

    Example:
    The climate category now distinguishes between support for government action ("climate_action": 0.8), environmental protection ("environmental_protection": 0.9), and opposition (e.g., "climate_skepticism": -0.8, "climate_hoax": -0.9).

    Config File References:
    Ensure that all related configuration files on GitHub reference one another appropriately. In particular:
        The primary Terminology JSON is used by the lookup function.
        Updates in one file must propagate correctly to any dependent modules.

3.2. Handling Ambiguity and Conflicts

    Detection of Ambiguity:
    When processing user input, the system calculates confidence scores for each potential mapping based on keyword matches and nuance weightings.
        Low Confidence: If no single mapping exceeds a predetermined confidence threshold, or if the input yields conflicting nuance (e.g., mixed positive and negative sentiment on the same issue), then the input is deemed ambiguous.

    Fallback and Clarification:
    In cases where the input is too vague or conflicted, the system must not force a mapping. Instead, it should return a standardized fallback response:

        "Can you please clarify your stance on [user's language]?"

    This rule ensures that the tool never assumes more than what the user has explicitly stated.

3.3. Capturing Hard-to-Map Terms

    Logging Ambiguous Inputs:
    Any user input that the system cannot confidently map (due to ambiguity or conflicting signals) must be logged in a separate configuration file, needsTermMapping.json.
        This file should capture:
            The raw user input.
            The confidence scores from attempted mappings.
            An indication that the input did not meet the mapping threshold.
    Continuous Improvement:
    The needsTermMapping.json file serves as a feedback mechanism for product and data teams. Regular reviews of this file will help refine and update the Terminology JSON, ensuring that the system evolves over time to better capture user intent.

Integration with the Overall System

    Terminology Mapping:
    The updated product requirements now explicitly require that all free-text user inputs are analyzed using the nuanced terminology lookup. This ensures context-aware, balanced mapping to standardized political terms.

    Feedback Loop:
    Hard-to-map inputs must be captured in needsTermMapping.json for ongoing review and iterative improvement of the mapping rules.

By incorporating these updates, your system will better reflect nuanced political views without making assumptions, and it will provide clear fallback prompts when users’ inputs need further clarification.

    Extended Features:
        PDF export functionality.
        Social sharing capabilities.
        Advanced survey integration.
        Enhanced terminology mapping.
    Infrastructure:
        Enhanced scalability.
        Additional data sources.
        Advanced analytics.

Testing & Deployment:

Testing Requirements:

    User acceptance testing with diverse voter groups.
    Cross-browser compatibility.
    Performance testing under load.
    Verification of terminology mapping accuracy.

Deployment Strategy:

    Cloud hosting with load balancing.
    Regular updates to data sources.

I need help improving this section of the terminology look up: "personalLiberty": {

      "individual freedom",
      "personal choice",

  },

A user entered: "I am tired of paying so much income tax! I work hard for my money and want some to pass on to my children."

And the analysis returned:   Individual Freedom and Personal Liberty: I want to be free to make my own choices and keep more of what I earn without excessive taxation.

This user's priority has NOTHING To do with freedom or personal liberty - it's all about money.  Please revise

Below is an updated version of the "personalLiberty" entry that refines the scope to focus on non-economic aspects of personal autonomy. This revision emphasizes freedom from government or societal interference in private life—explicitly excluding economic or taxation issues.

"personalLiberty": {
  "plainLanguage": [
    "individual freedom",
    "personal autonomy",
    "self-determination",
    "liberty from government control",
    "personal rights"

Explanation

    plainLanguage:
    The keywords now focus exclusively on aspects of personal autonomy (e.g., "personal autonomy," "self-determination") and avoid any reference to economic matters like taxes.

    standardTerm & plainEnglish:
    The descriptions clarify that this category is about individual freedom in personal, non-economic decisions rather than financial issues.

    nuance:
    A new nuance key "economic_issues" with a negative weighting (-0.9) has been added to help prevent the system from mapping economic or taxation concerns into this category.

This update should ensure that an input such as "I am tired of paying so much income tax! I work hard for my money and want some to pass on to my children." does not incorrectly map to "Personal Autonomy and Freedom" but instead would trigger the appropriate tax-related category.
You said:
Unfortunately that didn't improve the results.  Can we please separate any priority stated about taxes from personal freedoms entirely?  I fail to see the connection between them. 

Below is an updated version that explicitly separates personal autonomy from economic or tax-related issues. The description and nuance now clearly state that this category is solely about non-economic personal freedoms.
