# Project Overview

## Intent
This project aims to create a secure and user-friendly web application with:
- Authentication system for user management
- Profile management capabilities
- Secure data storage and retrieval

## Core Features
1. Authentication
   - Email/password login
   - Password reset functionality
   - User registration

2. User Profiles
   - Basic profile information storage
   - Profile management interface

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shadcn/ui for consistent UI components

### Backend (Supabase)
- User authentication service
- PostgreSQL database
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Profile management

### Database Schema
Currently implemented tables:
- profiles
  - id (uuid)
  - created_at (timestamp)
  - updated_at (timestamp)
  - username (text)
  - email (text)

## Known Issues & Solutions
1. Authentication Flow

2. User Experience
   - Issue: Need better error messaging
   - Solution: Added toast notifications for user feedback

## Next Steps
1. Improve error handling and user feedback
2. Add proper form validation
3. Implement proper loading states
4. Add proper TypeScript types for all components
5. Add comprehensive testing
